#### Speljongen - Gameboy emulator

Originally a port of [Coffee GB](https://github.com/trekawek/coffee-gb/tree/master) from java to C++ for poops and giggles,
while the CPU emulation remains mostly unchanged the memory emulation has been implemented slightly differently. The interface,
rendering and OS input handling has been all replaced with [SFML](https://sfml-dev.org) and implemented from scratch.
