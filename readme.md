#### Speljongen - Gameboy emulator

Started as a port of [Coffee GB](https://github.com/trekawek/coffee-gb/tree/master) from java to C++ for poops and giggles,
while the CPU/GPU emulation remains mostly unchanged the memory emulation has been implemented slightly differently. The interface,
rendering and OS input handling has been all replaced with [SFML](https://sfml-dev.org) and ImGui and implemented from scratch.


##### Building
Speljongen should compile on Windows, macOS and linux with the included CMake file.
There is also a Visual Studio 2017 project included (with dependencies) for Windows
users.

Speljongen depends on SFML and OpenGL libraries, and on linux you will need to install
pkgmanager and gtk+3 for the native file dialogue windows. On macOS the project needs
to link to AppKit and CoreServices for the same reason. The CMake file also supports
creating app bundles on macOS, which requires a valid icon set and XCode 9 command line
tools installed.
